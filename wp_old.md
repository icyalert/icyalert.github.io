### WP1: Climate data retrieval & event detection

Data from CMIP6, CMIP7 (when available) and C3S will first be retrieved and then pre-processed to produce sea-ice and climate indices. They will also be downscaled to 0.25Â° resolution.

### WP2: Prototype AI for multi-driver detection and evaluation

Causal links between winter drivers and summer sea-ice area will be quantified using the data produced in WP1. A causally-driven statistical prediction model will be developed and will serve as a baseline method. A prototype probabilistic ice-free Arctic predictor will be developed and compared to the baseline method.

### WP3: AI-enhanced ensemble initialization and dynamic prediction

We will generate winter state ensembles informed by key drivers and thresholds to initialize SMILE simulations. Sensitivity tests starting from these initial conditions will be conducted to evaluate the strength of initialized drivers in summer sea-ice predictability. We will retrain the probabilistic ice-free Arctic predictor, improving robustness and sample size.

### WP4: AI-driven future ice-free Arctic detection and prediction

Probabilistic ice-free Arctic predictions up to 2050 will be generated based on results from WP3, using the latest CMIP7 model outputs. We will also provide one-year-ahead probabilistic predictions of summer sea-ice conditions based on C3S observation-based seasonal forecasts.

### WP5: AI-driven future regional climate impacts

We will analyze the causal influence of vanishing Arctic sea ice on mid-latitude climates, focusing on Europe. We will also realize a sectoral impact assessment, including the Arctic navigability risks.

### WP6: Synthesis & risk assessment

Results from all WPs will be summarized into an Ice-Free Arctic Risk Catalogue, documenting the likelihood and uncertainty distributions of ice-free Arctic conditions across IPCC mitigation scenarios. We will develop storylines linking an ice-free Arctic to cascading risks, including atmospheric circulation changes, ship navigability risks, and Arctic marine heatwaves.

### WP7: Management and research training

IcyAlert will ensure a smoothless management through regular online and physical meetings, as well as a strong collaboration between the project partners and international collaborators. It will establish a learning environment, e.g. via specialized workshops. The outcomes of the project will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and diverse oral presentations at (inter)national conferences.
