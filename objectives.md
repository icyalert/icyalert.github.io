In IcyAlert, we propose to develop an **early warning system** for summer ice-free Arctic predictions (sea-ice area below 1 million kmÂ²) and its climate impacts. 

The three key project objectives of IcyAlert are:

**Objective 1**: Build a **prototype IcyAlert system** with bias correction and precondition detection using integrated observations and **CMIP6** data. We aim to derive the dynamical driving ice-free conditions in the Arctic, providing a baseline method for future model evaluation.

**Objective 2**: Optimize IcyAlert with **AI-driven ensemble simulations** and **causal analysis** for prioritized key climate processes. We aim to refine predictions and uncover key Arctic sea-ice impacts.

**Objective 3**: Apply IcyAlert to **CMIP7** data for downscaled year-round climate impact simulations and deliver **risk alerts** for the Arctic and extratropics. By leveraging a hierarchy of models, from AI/ML-enhanced predictions to downscaled impact models, we aim to use causal networks to enable localized risk assessments and actionable insights into abrupt climate changes and extreme events.
