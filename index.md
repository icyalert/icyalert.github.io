IcyAlert is a project funded by the [Novo Nordisk Fundation](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/challenge-accepted-new-funding-for-ambitious-projects-within-biomanufacturing-cardiometabolic-diseases-and-artificial-intelligence/).

The project goal is to improve predictions of Arctic ice-free summers and its potential climate impacts at multi-decadal time scale using global climate models, causal analysis and machine learning.

IcyAlert is led by the Danish Meteorological Institute ([DMI](http://research.dmi.dk/home/)), in partnership with the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium ([RMI](https://climdyn.meteo.be/)) and the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/research)).
