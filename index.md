**IcyAlert** stands for _Intelligent Climate Early Warning Alert for Arctic Ice-Free Summers_. It is a research project running from October 2025 to September 2031, which is funded by the Novo Nordisk Fundation ([NNF](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/challenge-accepted-new-funding-for-ambitious-projects-within-biomanufacturing-cardiometabolic-diseases-and-artificial-intelligence/)).

The project goal is to improve predictions of **Arctic ice-free summers** and its potential **climate impacts** at multi-decadal time scale using **global climate models**, **causal analysis** and **machine learning**.

IcyAlert is led by the Danish Meteorological Institute ([DMI](http://research.dmi.dk/home/)), in partnership with the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium ([RMI](https://climdyn.meteo.be/)) and the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/research)).
