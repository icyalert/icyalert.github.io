## Climate data

IcyAlert will use climate datasets from CMIP6 (~1Â° resolution) and the upcoming CMIP7 to analyze large-scale Arctic climate variability as outlined in IPCC AR6. A single-model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) will also be employed to extend training data from CMIP6/CMIP7 and enhance probabilistic predictions. IcyAlert will integrate winter conditions from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) multi-model seasonal forecasting system to improve next-year Arctic predictions. Model performance will be validated against satellite and reanalysis data.

## Causal analysis

IcyAlert will use the Liang-Kleeman information flow (LKIF) method as a primary causal method to quantify causal interactions between the different climate variables. This causal method will allow us to go beyond classical correlation analyses and identify the predictors of ice-free Arctic conditions, as well as its climate impacts. In IcyAlert, we will combine LKIF with explainable AI to improve ice-free Arctic predictions and assess its regional climate impacts. To ensure robustness, we will also compare results against alternative causal methods.

## AI-powered climate emulators

IcyAlert will develop a probabilistic ice-free Arctic predictor that maps inputs from integrated preconditions and drivers to outputs of summer sea-ice metrics and climate impact indices. Using
advanced probabilistic techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and diffusion models, the model will generate risk-informed predictions of ice-free conditions. This will form a prototype ice-free emulator, simulating ice-free scenarios under varying initial conditions and providing probabilistic outputs for decision-making and scenario analysis.

## Gefion

IcyAlert will use the Gefion supercomputer to perform its computations.
