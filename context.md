Arctic summer sea ice has been declining at an unprecedented rate, mainly caused by anthropogenic global warming ([IPCC, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157896.001)). The visible transition from ice-covered (high albedo) to ice-free (low albedo) ocean in summer amplifies solar heat absorption, intensifying surface warming ([Stroeve & Notz, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aade56)). This positive feedback accelerates polar amplification, drives further sea ice loss, and triggers cascading impacts on the global climate ([Meier & Stroeve, 2022](https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2022.114)). Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average ([Rantanen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00498-3)).

While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a summer ice-free Arctic (sea-ice area below 1 million kmÂ²) by mid-century ([IPCC, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157896.011)), emerging research highlights significant uncertainties, suggesting that the first ice-free day could occur as early as 2030, with timing projections varying widely across models and scenarios ([Jahn et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-023-00515-9)). Moreover, the loss of summer sea ice undermines climate stability at high and mid-latitudes, potentially fueling extreme weather and causing regional impacts, even if large uncertainties remain (e.g. [Outten et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-95-2023)).

In IcyAlert, we propose to address these uncertainties and to refine predictions of ice-free Arctic summers based on global climate models and satellite observations combined with causal analysis and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). This approach will not only improve the prediction accuracy of ice-free Arctic summers but will also provide deeper insights into the drivers of Arctic sea-ice variability, enabling more reliable early warning systems for regional climate impacts.
