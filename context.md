Arctic summer sea ice has been declining at an unprecedented rate, with models projecting ice-free conditions (sea-ice area below 1 million kmÂ²) by mid-century. The visible transition from ice-covered (high-albedo) to ice-free (low-albedo) ocean in summer amplifies solar heat absorption, intensifying surface warming. This positive feedback accelerates polar amplification, drives further sea ice loss, and triggers cascading impacts on the global climate. Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average.
